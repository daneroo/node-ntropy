This is a node module for entropy coding.

First candidates are Huffman Coding and Arithmetic Coding.

The reason for writing this module was to get test-infected!
I wanted to write something useful, while learing the proper practices of TDD.


# TODO

* register as npm module
* pick testing/assertion style
* wire mocha basics
* integrate with travis-CI
* look at https://github.com/kkaefer/node-bitstream
